How to put the Salix Live ISO on USB?

1. Open the iso using an archiver program (file-roller, xarchiver, 7-zip, ...)
2. Extract all the files and folders (boot, packages and salixlive) to the USB root directory.
3. Go the "boot" directory on the USB key.
4. Run "bootinst.sh" if you're on Linux or Unix, "bootinst.bat" if you're on Windows. Alternatively, you can run "install-on-USB" if you're on Linux and have grub2 installed. This will prevent the first "reboot on first boot" operation.

On the first boot on the USB key, a better bootloader will be installed (grub2) and the boot process will reboot, it's normal.
